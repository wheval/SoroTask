### Explanation of Variables:

- **`SOROBAN_RPC_URL`**: This is the endpoint the bot uses to communicate with the network. You can use public nodes provided by Stellar or set up your own.
- **`NETWORK_PASSPHRASE`**: This ensures your bot is talking to the right network (e.g., Futurenet, Testnet, or Public Network).
- **`KEEPER_SECRET`**: Your keeper wallet's secret key. _Keep this private and never commit it to version control (we've ensured `.env` is ignored by git)._
- **`CONTRACT_ID`**: The deployed SoroTask contract address that the keeper will monitor and execute tasks from.
- **`POLLING_INTERVAL_MS`**: How often (in milliseconds) the keeper checks for due tasks. Lower values mean more frequent checks but higher RPC usage.
- **`MAX_CONCURRENT_READS`**: Maximum number of tasks to query in parallel during each poll. Higher values speed up polling but increase RPC load.
- **`MAX_CONCURRENT_EXECUTIONS`**: Maximum number of tasks that can be executed simultaneously. Controls execution throughput.
- **`MAX_TASK_ID`**: The keeper will check task IDs from 1 to this value. Alternatively, use `TASK_IDS` to specify exact task IDs.
- **`TASK_IDS`**: Optional comma-separated list of specific task IDs to monitor (e.g., "1,2,3,5"). If set, overrides `MAX_TASK_ID`.
- **`WAIT_FOR_CONFIRMATION`**: Whether to wait for transaction confirmation after submitting. Set to 'false' for fire-and-forget mode.
- **`LOG_LEVEL`**: Minimum log severity to emit (`trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`).
- **`LOG_FORMAT`**: Optional log renderer. Leave unset for JSON logs; set to `pretty` for local human-readable output.
- **`KEEPER_STATE_DIR` / `IDEMPOTENCY_STATE_FILE`**: Location of persisted execution idempotency locks used to prevent duplicate submissions.
- **`EXECUTION_LOCK_TTL_MS`**: How long an in-progress execution lock is considered valid before stale recovery allows new work.
- **`EXECUTION_COMPLETED_MARKER_TTL_MS`**: Short-lived post-success marker to reduce accidental immediate duplicate submissions.
- **`KEEPER_ADMIN_TOKEN`**: Bearer token required to call the keeper admin pause/resume API.
- **`KEEPER_SHARD_INDEX` / `KEEPER_SHARD_COUNT`**: Stable shard assignment controls so multiple keeper instances can partition work without ambiguous ownership.
- **`KEEPER_SHARD_LABEL`**: Optional human-readable shard identifier used in metrics and logs.
- **`DB_SHARD_BASE_COUNT` / `DB_SHARD_MAX_COUNT`**: Minimum and maximum Postgres shard counts for automatic scaling. The manager scales shard usage within these bounds.
- **`DB_SHARD_SCALE_UP_THRESHOLD` / `DB_SHARD_SCALE_DOWN_THRESHOLD`**: Hysteresis thresholds for shard scaling decisions, preventing flapping during load transitions.
- **`DB_SHARD_USER_CAPACITY` / `DB_SHARD_TASK_CAPACITY`**: Capacity heuristics used to translate active user load and task volume into shard count.
- **`DB_SHARD_AUTO_SCALING`**: Enable or disable Postgres shard auto-scaling while preserving safe fallback behavior.
- **`P2P_ENABLED` / `P2P_SHARED_SECRET`**: Enables signed peer discovery and load-aware ownership. See [P2P Keeper Discovery](./docs/p2p-keeper-discovery.md).
- **`P2P_PUBLIC_URL` / `P2P_BOOTSTRAP_PEERS`**: Advertised peer URL and initial peer list used to join the keeper mesh.
- **`DRIFT_WARNING_SECONDS` / `DRIFT_CRITICAL_SECONDS`**: Thresholds for recurring execution drift classification.
- **`RESOLVER_FUNCTIONS_CONFIG`**: Optional JSON file mapping task resolver IDs to sandboxed JS/WASM functions.
- **`RESOLVER_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS`**: Default per-invocation resolver timeout.
- **`RESOLVER_FAILURE_MODE`**: `skip` fails closed on resolver errors; `allow` fails open for controlled migrations.

## Serverless Resolvers

The keeper can evaluate custom JavaScript or WASM resolver logic before enqueueing a due task. Resolvers run after interval and gas checks, inside a bounded runtime with static capability checks, payload size limits, and per-call timeouts. Tasks without resolver IDs are unchanged.

See [Serverless Resolver Runtime](./docs/serverless-resolvers.md) for configuration, authoring examples, and the security model.

## RPC Load Balancer Configuration

The keeper supports a custom load balancer for Soroban RPC nodes to improve reliability, performance, and scalability. This enables distributing RPC requests across multiple Soroban RPC endpoints with health monitoring, automatic failover, and load distribution.

### Environment Variables for RPC Load Balancing

To enable the RPC load balancer, configure the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```env
# RPC Load Balancer Configuration
RPC_ENDPOINTS="https://rpc1.soroban.network,https://rpc2.soroban.network,https://rpc3.soroban.network"
RPC_ENDPOINT_WEIGHTS="3,2,1"
RPC_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS=30000
RPC_HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
RPC_LOAD_BALANCING_STRATEGY=weighted_round_robin
```

### Explanation of RPC Load Balancer Variables:

- **`RPC_ENDPOINTS`**: Comma-separated list of RPC URLs to distribute requests across (e.g., "https://rpc1.example.com,https://rpc2.example.com")
- **`RPC_ENDPOINT_WEIGHTS`**: Optional comma-separated weights for weighted round-robin distribution (e.g., "2,1" - first endpoint gets twice as many requests as second)
- **`RPC_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS`**: Interval in milliseconds between health checks (default: 30000ms = 30 seconds)
- **`RPC_HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT_MS`**: Timeout in milliseconds for health check requests (default: 5000ms = 5 seconds)
- **`RPC_LOAD_BALANCING_STRATEGY`**: Load balancing algorithm to use ("round_robin", "least_connections", or "weighted_round_robin")

### Configuration Notes:

- When using the load balancer, the `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` environment variable is ignored
- The load balancer automatically handles failover when endpoints become unhealthy
- Health monitoring uses `getNetwork()` and `getLatestLedger()` calls to verify RPC endpoint availability
- Metrics for the load balancer are exposed via the standard `/metrics/prometheus` endpoint
- The load balancer is backward compatible - if only one RPC endpoint is configured, it operates in single-server mode

## Health Status Interpretation

The keeper health endpoint reports richer state than a binary up/down signal. Operators will see:

- `healthy`: keeper is polling and RPC connectivity is working normally.
- `degraded`: partial issues are present, such as RPC disconnects or a half-open circuit breaker.
- `stale`: polling has not refreshed within the configured `HEALTH_STALE_THRESHOLD_MS` window.
- `unhealthy`: the keeper is not operational due to missing polls or failed RPC health.

This makes it easier to distinguish slow recovery from critical outages during incident response.

## P2P Keeper Discovery

The optional P2P layer lets keepers discover each other, advertise load, and split ownership with load-aware rendezvous hashing. It is disabled by default; when disabled or unhealthy, the keeper falls back to configured shard ownership.

See [P2P Keeper Discovery](./docs/p2p-keeper-discovery.md) for setup, security review notes, health fields, and failure behavior.

### Dead-Letter Queue Configuration

The keeper includes a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) for handling repeatedly failing tasks:

```env
# Maximum number of failures before a task is quarantined (default: 5)
DLQ_MAX_FAILURES=5

# Time window for counting failures in milliseconds (default: 3600000 = 1 hour)
DLQ_FAILURE_WINDOW_MS=3600000

# Enable automatic quarantine of repeatedly failing tasks (default: true)
DLQ_AUTO_QUARANTINE=true

# Maximum number of dead-letter records to keep (default: 1000)
DLQ_MAX_RECORDS=1000
```

The DLQ automatically isolates tasks that fail repeatedly, preventing resource waste and providing diagnostic information for operators. See [Dead-Letter Queue Documentation](./docs/dead-letter-queue.md) for details.

## Setup Instructions

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

Docker provides a reproducible, portable deployment that works on any cloud VM, VPS, or container orchestrator. This is the recommended approach for production deployments.

#### Quick Start with Docker Compose

1. **Navigate to the Repository Root**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/sorotask
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   
   Copy the example environment file and configure it:
   ```bash
   cp keeper/.env.example keeper/.env
   ```
   
   Edit `keeper/.env` with your configuration (see Environment Variables section below).

3. **Start the Keeper**
   
   From the repository root:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Build the Docker image with multi-stage optimization
   - Start the keeper container in detached mode
   - Mount `./keeper/data` for task registry persistence
   - Expose port 3001 for health checks and metrics
   - Automatically restart the container unless explicitly stopped

4. **View Logs**
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f keeper
   ```

5. **Check Health Status**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   ```

6. **Stop the Keeper**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

#### Docker Commands Reference

**Build the image:**
```bash
cd keeper
npm run docker:build
```

**Run standalone container:**
```bash
cd keeper
npm run docker:run
```

**Manual Docker commands:**
```bash
# Build
docker build -t sorotask-keeper ./keeper

# Run with environment file and volume
docker run -d \
  --name sorotask-keeper \
  --env-file ./keeper/.env \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -v $(pwd)/keeper/data:/app/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  sorotask-keeper

# View logs
docker logs -f sorotask-keeper

# Stop and remove
docker stop sorotask-keeper
docker rm sorotask-keeper
```

#### Docker Deployment Features

- **Multi-stage build**: Optimized image size with separate dependency and runtime stages
- **Security hardening**: Runs as non-root user (`node`)
- **Health checks**: Built-in health monitoring via `/health` endpoint
- **Data persistence**: Task registry persisted in `./keeper/data` volume
- **Automatic restart**: Container restarts automatically on failure
- **Log rotation**: Configured with 10MB max size and 3 file retention
- **Minimal base**: Uses `node:20-alpine` for smallest footprint

#### Cloud Deployment Examples

**AWS EC2 / DigitalOcean / Linode:**
```bash
# SSH into your VM
ssh user@your-server-ip

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/sorotask.git
cd sorotask

# Configure environment
cp keeper/.env.example keeper/.env
nano keeper/.env  # Edit with your settings

# Start with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d

# Verify it's running
docker compose ps
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

**Kubernetes:**
```bash
# Build and push to registry
docker build -t your-registry/sorotask-keeper:latest ./keeper
docker push your-registry/sorotask-keeper:latest

# Create ConfigMap from .env
kubectl create configmap keeper-config --from-env-file=keeper/.env

# Deploy (create your k8s manifests based on docker-compose.yml)
kubectl apply -f k8s/keeper-deployment.yaml
```

### Local Development Setup

Once you have your prerequisite software and environment variables ready, follow these steps on a clean environment:

1. **Navigate to the Keeper Directory**  
   Open your terminal and navigate to the `keeper` folder if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   cd keeper
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install the required Node.js packages (`soroban-client`, `dotenv`, and `node-fetch`):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Keeper Bot**  
   Start the Node.js application to begin listening for and executing SoroTask tasks:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

If successful, you will see output indicating that the Keeper has started, along with logs of its periodic checks for due tasks!

## Dead-Letter Queue

The keeper includes a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) system that automatically handles repeatedly failing tasks:

### What is the Dead-Letter Queue?

The DLQ captures and isolates tasks that fail repeatedly due to:
- Invalid configuration
- Broken target contracts
- Persistent permission problems
- Insufficient gas balance

### Key Features

- **Automatic Quarantine**: Tasks exceeding failure thresholds are automatically isolated
- **Diagnostic Context**: Full error history, stack traces, and task configuration preserved
- **Operator Visibility**: HTTP endpoints and Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- **Recovery Mechanism**: Manual recovery after issues are resolved

### Inspecting Quarantined Tasks

```bash
# Get DLQ overview
curl http://localhost:3000/dead-letter

# Get specific task details
curl http://localhost:3000/dead-letter/123
```

### Prometheus Metrics

```
keeper_quarantined_tasks_count          # Current quarantined tasks
keeper_tasks_quarantined_total          # Total tasks quarantined
keeper_tasks_recovered_total            # Total tasks recovered
keeper_tasks_quarantined_skipped_total  # Tasks skipped due to quarantine
```

### Demo

Run the interactive demo to see the DLQ in action:

```bash
node examples/dead-letter-demo.js
```

For complete documentation, see [Dead-Letter Queue Guide](./docs/dead-letter-queue.md).

## Mock Soroban RPC for Faster Local Testing

If you want to test keeper flows without a full Soroban node, the keeper includes a lightweight mock JSON-RPC server.

```bash
cd keeper
npm run mock-rpc
```

Then point the keeper at it:

```bash
export SOROBAN_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4100
export NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022"
```

Detailed usage, supported methods, and test examples are in [docs/mock-soroban-rpc.md](./docs/mock-soroban-rpc.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Account not found"

- **Cause**: The account associated with your `KEEPER_SECRET` does not exist on the network you are trying to use.
- **Solution**: Fund your keeper account. If you are on Testnet or Futurenet, use the [Stellar Laboratory Friendbot](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator) to fund the public key associated with your secret. Ensure you've set the correct `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` and match the network on Stellar Laboratory.

### Issue: "RPC error" or "Could not connect to server"

- **Cause**: The bot cannot reach the specified RPC endpoint, or the endpoint rejected the request due to rate-limiting or an invalid URL setup.
- **Solution**:
  - Double-check your `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` in the `.env` file for any typos. Ensure it includes the proper protocol (e.g., `https://`).
  - If you're using a public RPC, you might be rate-limited. Wait a few moments and try again, or switch to a dedicated/private RPC provider node.

### Issue: `Error: Cannot find module 'dotenv'` or `Error: Cannot find module 'soroban-client'`

- **Cause**: Application dependencies were not correctly or fully installed.
- **Solution**: Ensure you ran `npm install` inside the `keeper/` directory correctly. Try clearing cache or removing `node_modules` (`rm -rf node_modules`) and running `npm install` again.

## Chaos Testing

The keeper includes a comprehensive chaos testing framework to validate resilience under realistic failure conditions. This helps ensure the keeper can handle network issues, RPC failures, and degraded performance.

### Running Chaos Tests

```bash
# Run all chaos scenarios
npm run chaos-test

# Run specific scenarios
npm run chaos-test -- --scenario=latency,ratelimit

# List available scenarios
npm run chaos-test:list

# Run single scenario
npm run chaos-test:single latency

# Save report to file
npm run chaos-test -- --output=json --file=chaos-report.json
```

### Available Scenarios

1. **Latency Spikes** - Test timeout handling with random delays
2. **Partial RPC Failure** - Test graceful degradation when some methods fail
3. **Rate Limiting** - Test backoff behavior under throttling
4. **Flaky Network** - Test circuit breaker recovery
5. **Gradual Degradation** - Test adaptive behavior to worsening conditions
6. **Complete Outage** - Test worst-case scenario handling

### Integration with Tests

Chaos tests are integrated into the Jest test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests including chaos tests
npm test

# Run only chaos tests
npm test -- chaos.test.js
```

See [Chaos Testing Documentation](./docs/CHAOS_TESTING.md) for detailed information.

## Docker Deployment

The Keeper ships with a multi-stage Dockerfile and a `docker-compose.yml` at the repo root so you can run it on any server with a single command — no local Node.js installation required.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) ≥ 24 (tested on 29.x)
- Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose` — space, not hyphen)

### Quick Start (recommended)

```bash
# 1. From the repo root, copy and fill in the environment file
cp keeper/.env.example keeper/.env
# Edit keeper/.env with your KEEPER_SECRET, CONTRACT_ID, etc.

# 2. Build the image and start the keeper in the background
docker compose up --build -d

# 3. Tail logs
docker compose logs -f keeper
```

The keeper's health and metrics endpoint will be reachable at `http://localhost:3000/health`.

### Prometheus Metrics

Prometheus-formatted metrics are available at `http://localhost:3000/metrics/prometheus`. See [docs/prometheus-metrics.md](./docs/prometheus-metrics.md) for detailed metric descriptions and Grafana dashboard examples.

### Check Health

```bash
# Should return {"status":"ok","uptime":...}
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Or let Docker tell you (after ~30 s start_period)
docker compose ps
# Look for "healthy" in the STATUS column
```

### Data Persistence

The task registry (`data/tasks.json`) is stored in `./keeper/data/` on the host and mounted into the container. It survives container restarts and upgrades automatically.

Note: task IDs are expected to be sequential for a healthy registration history. The keeper exposes allocation summaries that surface missing IDs or duplicate registration events so operators can distinguish delayed task discovery from actual registry drift.

### Standalone Docker Commands (npm scripts)

If you prefer to manage the container yourself without Compose, two npm convenience scripts are available. Run them from inside the `keeper/` directory:

```bash
# Build the image
npm run docker:build

# Run the container (reads .env from the current directory)
npm run docker:run
```

### Stop / Restart

```bash
# Stop (data volume is preserved)
docker compose down

# Restart after config changes
docker compose up -d --build
```
